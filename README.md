# E-commerce-Back-End-using-Express.js
This repository contains the back-end files for an e-commerce website built using Express.js, allowing users to manage products, categories, and tags through a MySQL database.

# User Story
As a manager at an internet retail company, I want a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies so that my company can compete with other e-commerce companies.

# Acceptance Criteria
# Database Connection:

Given a functional Express.js API, when I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, then I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize.
# Database Setup:

When I enter schema and seed commands, then a development database is created and is seeded with test data.
# Starting the Application:

When I enter the command to invoke the application, then my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.
# API Routes:

When I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags, then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
# CRUD Operations:

When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core, then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
